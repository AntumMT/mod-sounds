TODO:
- add ambiance registration for biomes
- add option to get sound by string name in "SoundGroup:get" using string.match
- create sounds.glass group
- shorten length of rain_light, rain_medium, & wind
- allow setting explicit parameters for individual sounds in SoundGroup instances
- tests:
	- fix wrong sound selected when changing groups (example: select #2, switch to group with one sound, switch to group with two sounds, press play)
- use keyword "all" in "sounds.disabled_groups" to disable built-in sounds groups instead of separate "sounds.enable_builtin_groups" setting
